instructions = You will receive some RDF triples. Your task is to generate a textual description based on the triples. The first triple conveys information that the entity represented by its subject is not a suitable recommendation. The subject on the first triple is not a suitable recommendation because it holds the property represented by the first triple predicate and the first triple object. The remaining triples are auxiliary triples to enrich the textual description. Please generate a textual description stating why the triple subject is not a suitable recommendation. Please return only the textual description. Avoid explanation.
